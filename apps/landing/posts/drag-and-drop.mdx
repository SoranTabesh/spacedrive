It's been an exciting couple of months since we launched Spacedrive. We're thrilled to share that we've hit **103k** unique installations, with an average runtime of **50 minutes**. The enthusiasm and feedback from our community have been incredible, and your requests for new features have not gone unnoticed.

Our team has been working tirelessly to turn your most-wanted features into reality. We will be reaching feature pairity with Finder and Apple Photos sooner than we thought, for those desperate to fully make the switch to Spacedrive.

## Drag and drop

The Explorer is the most intricate user interface we have ever designed, now with drag and drop it is one big step closer to having everything you need from a file explorer.

## AI Labeling

Our first of many AI powered features to come, we create labels for images using a lightweight object detection model running on-device.

## Advanced search

We've added a new search bar to the top of the Explorer, which allows you to search for files and folders by name, content, and metadata. You can also use the search bar to filter by file type, date, and more.

## Spacedrop

Spacedrop is our solution to sharing files and folders with others. For now you can try it between devices on your local network, but we have big plans for Spacedrop in the future.

## MORE DOCS!

Our docs have been lacking, until now. We've added a plethora of new guides on how to use Spacedrive, how to get the most out of it and even detailed features we're working on.

## Tabs

You can open multiple tabs in the Explorer, and switch between them using the tab bar at the top of the window.

## And so much more...

We've also shipped these major features since the launch:

- Multi-select in the Explorer
- A bar for Quick View to view surrounding media
- CPU usage control slider
- Improved virtual filesystem

## Up Next?

We've got big plans for the next major release:

- **Connect devices**:
  One of the biggest technologies we've been tackling is multi-device connections and database sync. This has been a cornerstone of Spacedrive from the start, but yet to make it into production. So, we're speeding up the process by introducing an encrypted, cloud-assisted sync instead of peer-to-peer sync using CRDTs, which we will ship later.
- **iOS and Android**:
  With sync in place, we'll be releasing the alpha versions of our mobile apps for iOS and Android, if you are already a user of Spacedrive you're invited to join, we'll reach out via email with an invite.

- **Column View**:
  A hugely demanded explorer view, for good reason. Column view is the most popular view for managing files, but also the hardest to engineer! Along with column view will come upgraded list view, with tree support.
